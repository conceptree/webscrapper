# WebScrapper
**Python Web Scrapper**

Simple webscrapper using Pyton and BeautifullSoup.

The program is coded to scrap three amazon stores, UK, ES and DE but feel free to reuse to your own purposes. I believe that que selectors will be the same across stores.

```
Once running the ws.py
Choose the store you want to scrap
and insert the keyword for your search results
Then you shall generate the csv file with all the resultant information
```
